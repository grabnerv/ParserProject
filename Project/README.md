Project: This is a Python parser written in ANTLR4. The 3rd deliverable is the most complete,
allowing for the parsing of variables, functions, and the tokenization of indents and dedents.

Authors: Van Grabner, Ethan Johnson

Environment reqs: Java compiler, antlr4, and (optionally) antlr4 GUI for viewing the parse tree.

How to run: There are 3 basic commands to run our parser.

% antlr4 Deliverable3.g4 
% javac *.java 
% grun Deliverable3 start -gui ./project_deliverable_3.py
// replace ./project_deliverable_3.py with your desired input file.
